## A Sunlike Star From Birth to Death: A Simple Simulation on Python 

### Abstract
A course of study on star formation and life-cycle, which delved into the physics governing the properties of a star. To simulate a sun-like star on Python and plot the variation of its properties. By solving the differential equations for mass, density, pressure, and luminosity variations, along with the temperature gradients for convective and radiative transfer, and the equation of state. The plots describe the variations of the starâ€™s properties and what they mean for the life and death of the star.
